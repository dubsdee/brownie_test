## 
## Script to manually calculate the staking rate of SPELL / sSPELL and tracks /
## compares the result to the abra_rate file. 
## If new rate, the new rate is printed to console and written to the abra_rate file, followed by line increment
## Script pulls information every 60 seconds via Infura
